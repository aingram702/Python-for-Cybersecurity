# Python-for-Cybersecurity
Python code for red and blue team operations. Projects are from the book "Python for Cybersecurity" by Howard E. Poston III.


Multi-Tool branch is a separate project, where I am planning on combining all the functionality of these scripts, into one big "Multi-Tool". The plan is to create a red team/pentesting super tool. So stay tuned for that...
